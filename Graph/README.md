# Graphs

G = (V, E)

## Terminology

- Vertice / Node
- Edge / Link
    - If edges has directions, it's called directed graph
    - Otherwise, it's called undirected graph
- Path
- Type of Graphs
  - Directed Graph
  - Non-Directed Graph
  - DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)

### Representation of Undirected & Directed Graph

- Adjacency Matrix
- Cost Adjacency Matrix
- Adjacency List
- Compact List
  
## Traversal / Algorithm

- Breadth First Search (BFS)
  - Characteristic similar to Tree Level Order Traversal
  - Using Queue
- Depth First Search (DFS)
  - Using Recursion
